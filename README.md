	<section id="Project_Background_info">
		<p>This project involved html, css, and javscript in order to create a random passwrod generator.  Instead of using prompts to the screen for userinput, I provided a GUI for the user to select the paramters they want for their password.  This locks down options to prevent user input that would break the application.  In the event they forget to click a checkmark for the parameters, the user will receive an alert saying the need to check at least one.  Once generated, there is a button to copy the password to their clipboard. Overall, I am happy with the result of this applcation.  It works as intended.  </p>
